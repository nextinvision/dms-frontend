## 📝 NOTES

- All changes use mock data and localStorage for persistence
- Backend integration will be done separately
- WhatsApp sharing uses deep link: `https://wa.me/{phone}?text={message}`
- Job card numbering is frontend-only; backend should implement proper sequence management
- Document uploads store File objects and object URLs; backend integration will need file upload API
